# math_lib
Added a comment to declare math_lib.div(numerator, denominator) to be pretty darn good

math_lib.add(first, second) adds two numbers together and returns their sum

# run.sh
runs calculate.py, a file which will execute all math_lib functions on two argumets if given, or else wait for their input as a command line entry
